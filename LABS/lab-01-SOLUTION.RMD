This lab introduces you to Markdown, a popular 'language' for creating data-driven reports. This week you will practice some simple formatting rules using the [Markdown Tutorial](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) created by Adam Pritchard.


## Lab Instructions

Create a short bio for the class. Each question requires a different type of text or media. Use [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to format each answer correctly.

1. Add your name to a **Header 1** element called, "Bio of YOUR NAME".
2. Add a **picture** of yourself to the bio.
3. Write a short **paragraph** about why you joined this class.
4. Create a **list** of three fun facts about yourself. 
5. Add a **link** to the website of your degree program of study at ASU.
6. OPTIONAL: Embed a YouTube **video** of a weird song that is currently in your music playlist.

## Advanced Markdown Functionality

### Naming Files

I have asked you to use the following naming format for assignments: **Lab-01-Lecy.Rmd**

Note that *.Rmd* stands for R Markdown files. R Studio has adopted the Markdown 'language' and added functionality using code chunks and many more options. See the [R Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf) to get a sense of the extensiveness of options you have.

Basic script files have the *.R* extension, and RMD files will use the *.Rmd* extension. These file extensions can be written as *.RMD*, *.Rmd*, or *.rmd*. 



### Organizing Images

Note that you insert images in Markdown documents by creating an image placeholder with "![]" and referencing the file name in parentheses:

```{r, eval=F}
![](profile_pic.png)
```

When you render the document, Markdown requires that the image be saved in the same folder as your lab .Rmd file. If you have a lot of images, you can also store them in a subfolder, and reference them as follows (the folder is called "figures" in this example):

```{r, eval=F}
![](figures/profile_pic.png)
```

It is a good idea to get into the practice of storing images and other assets in a separate folder, otherwise your directories will quickly get cluttered.


### Image Size

I 


```
![](figures/lecy.jpg)
```

```{r, eval=F}


![bio](figures/lecy.jpg)

'```{css}
img[alt=bio] { width: 100px; }
'```

```
