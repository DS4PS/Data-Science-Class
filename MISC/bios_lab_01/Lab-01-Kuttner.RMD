<img src="EKuttner.jpg" alt="EKuttner" width="200" height="200"/>


## 	My Department

[College of Public Service and Community Solutions](https://publicservice.asu.edu/)




## Interest in the Course

I am a first year PhD student. I have very little experience with programming. I would like to understand data science and R so that I can apply what I learn while doing research. The last programming course I took was in 1981 and I was using punch cards to code in Pascal!


## Three Things About Me

  * I am very new to programming.  
  * I am getting my PhD in Public Administration and Policy so that someday I can work in a think-tank.  
  * I don't have a playlist! 


# Bonus - I love to crochet animals
