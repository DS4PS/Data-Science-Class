# Bio for Tania Hernandez
![](C:\Program Files\RStudio\bin\pandoc\Tania Hernandez small.jpg)

## My Home Department

["School of Community Resources and Development"](https://scrd.asu.edu/)


## Interest in the Course

I am auditing this course for two reasons. First, I want to learn R. Second, I am planning to work with the Form 990 database to study nonprofit closure and I think this course will be helpful to explore analysis options. 

## Three Things About Me

1. I am the only Mexican that doesn't like spicy food.
2. I am co-president of the Graduate Club of my School, co-chair of the ASU Latinx Graduate Student Alliance and volunteer of the GPSA.
3. I will publish a book next year. It is about nonprofit closure of social service organizations in Mexico City.
