<h1>Bio of Anthony Gallegos</h1>

<h1> About Me</h1>

<p>I have a varied background with quite a few interests and experiences. I graduated from ASU in 2008 with a B.S. in Justice Studies, and simulteneously commissioned as an Aviation Officer in the Army National Guard. Shortly after, I worked at The Boeing Company as a technical author/liaison engineer, writing publications and guidence for military aircraft. After about five years of this, I started working at Arizona State University's Center for Child Well-Being, and enrolled in the M.S. Program Evaluation and Data Analytics program. My hobbies and passions are probably a bit boring to most people, as I am more apt to watch a documentary or read a book than watch most tv shows, and I have been an avid GNU/Linux user for around 15 years.</p>

<h2> Interest in the Course</h2>

<p>As a GNU/Linux user, I am very interested in free and open source software. R is something I've seen in multiple environments, but I have never had the opportunity to use. Moreover, my interests are typically centered on social policy, and as a student in the Program Evaluation program this course seems perfectly aligned with my field of study. I would love to learn how to use R to create dashboards that other people can use to easily look at any analysis I have done.</p>
<h2> Three Things About Me</h2>

+ I can play about a half dozen woodwind & brass instruments. 

<h2> BONUS: Something Weird in my Playlist</h2>

<p> Some context here... the Miami Dolphin Cheerleaders released a video to the tune of Call Me Maybe by Carle Rae. Then, a Special Forces unit released a parody to it and sent it to them. Their production company eventually released a side by side version, found in the link below.</p>
