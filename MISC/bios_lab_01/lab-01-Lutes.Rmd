## Interest in the Course

In order to understand the true impact of social media on marketing and public relations, statistical analysis is already taking place. It is now evident that 93% of marketers are using one or more forms of social media to interact with customers. This large amount of usage on behalf of the marketing industry has a causation that must be studied for future practitioners to manipulate and theorize upon media effects with non-traditional media. There are challenges still facing marketers and their true understanding of social media effects on their industry.
