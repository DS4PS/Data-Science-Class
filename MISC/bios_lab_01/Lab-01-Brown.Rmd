# Bio for Kendelle Brown

## My Home Department

## Interest in the Course

I was interested in taking Intro to Data Science for the Social Sector because I work in the nonprofit sector and I want to use the skills I gain through the Program Evaluation program to evaluate youth related programs to ensure their effectiveness. I've heard a lot of good things about R from past classmates and am excited to learn how to utilize the program. 


## Three Things About Me

1. Howl's Moving Castle is my favorite movie. 
2. Reading is my favorite hobby.
3. I have a dog named Windsor (pictured above).
