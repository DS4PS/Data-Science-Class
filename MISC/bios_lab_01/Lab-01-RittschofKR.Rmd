# Bio for Kerri Rittschof
![](C:\Users\kritt\OneDrive\Pictures\pic.jpg)

## My Home Department

[Center for Child Well-Being](https://childwellbeing.asu.edu/)


## Interest in the Course

I am interested in project evaluation; thus, I believe this course will assist in the ability to do a deeper dive into the data to find information to guide decisions for the children, people, and programs I work with. AND, I think it is cool to learn something new.


## Three Things About Me

1. I run! The furthest distance to date was a 60k in the rain and mud.
2. My 22nd wedding anniversary is when this assignment is due (8/24).
3. I have two Boston Terriers, and one is the LOVE of my life.
