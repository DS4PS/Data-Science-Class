# Bio for Steve Kilar

## Interest in the Course

I am taking this course because I would like to expand my data analysis and presentation skills. I work for a nonprofit that often analyzes government records, including databases, and I hope that what I learn in this course will help me advance my work. I also think the exposure to R, and data science generally, will help me think of new areas of research that I can explore during and after my doctoral studies.
