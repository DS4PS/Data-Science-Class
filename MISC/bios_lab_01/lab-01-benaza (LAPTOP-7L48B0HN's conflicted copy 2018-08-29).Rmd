![bio](pmb2.png)


## My Home Department

[ASU Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication](https://cronkite.asu.edu/degree-programs/graduate/phd)

## Interest in the Course

I am a communications strategist and mass communication PhD Student. I consider myself as a scholar activist for social justice as well as a popular culture thought leader for brand marketing, diversity, and the inclusion of women of color in the business of entertainment, media, and sports. I believe data is a powerful driver for robust messaging that can persuade and inspire people towards equality. I believe CPP 591: Intro to Data Science for the Social Sector will sharpen my skill set to organize data for my dissertation.
