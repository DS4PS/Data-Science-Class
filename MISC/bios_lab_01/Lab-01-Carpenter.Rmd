[ASU College of Public Service & Community Solutions](https://publicservice.asu.edu)


## Interest in the Course

I am a first-year candidate in the dual MSW/MPA program. I have a background in Child Welfare and care deeply about the outcomes for our foster youth. I have a certificate in cross-sector leadership and that has introduced the importance of all sectors and how data drives many important policy and practice decisions. I am interested in understanding data to make it consumable for all stakeholders as data can have implications in Child Welfare with grants, policy, and program development. 


## Three Things About Me

1.	I work in the College doing special events for the Dean's Office and Academic Personnel.
2.	I completed my undergraduate degree in Social Work in three years. 
3.	I have two younger sisters who keep me busy.
