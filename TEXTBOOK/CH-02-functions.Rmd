# Functions


```{r, echo=F }

knitr::opts_chunk$set( echo = TRUE, message=F, warning=F, fig.width=8 )

```



## Key Concepts

```{r, fig.cap="Anatomy of a function", echo=F }
knitr::include_graphics( "figures/function.png" )
```

```{r, fig.cap="Assignment of output values", echo=F }
knitr::include_graphics( "figures/assignment.png" )
```

After reading this chapter you should be able to define the following:

* function
* argument
* object
* assignment



## Computer Programs as Recipes

Computer programs are powerful because they allow us to codify recipes for complex tasks, save them, share them, and build upon them. 

In the simplest form, a computer program is like a recipe. It is a set of steps completed in order with the goal of 

## Example Function

As you get started in R you will be working with existing functions, not writing your own. It is, however, constructive to see how one is created. This example demonstrates the use of a mortgage calculator that will take a loan size, term, and interest rate and return a monthly payment. 

```{r}
   calcMortgage <- function( principal, years, APR )
   {

      months <- years * 12
      int.rate <- APR / 12
      
      # amortization formula
      monthly.payment <- ( principal * int.rate ) / 
                         (1 - (1 + int.rate)^(-months) )
      
      monthly.payment <- round( monthly.payment, 2 )
      
      return( monthly.payment )
   
   }
```


Let's then see what the payments will be for a:

- $100,000 loan 
- 30-year mortgage 
- 5% annual interest rate 

```{r}
calcMortgage( principal=100000, years=30, APR=0.05  )
```

## Default Argument Values

Note that the loan function needs all three of the input values in order to calculate the loan size. If we were to omit one required value, we would get an error. 

```{r, eval=F}
calcMortgage( principal=100000  )
# Error in calcMortgage(APR = 0.05, principal = 1e+05):  
#  argument "years" is missing, with no default 
```



When creating functions, we might have a good idea of typical use cases. If true, we can try to guess at reasonable user parameters. For example, perhaps we are working at a bank where most of the customers take out 30-year mortgages, and interest rates have been stable at 5 percent. We can set these as default values when we create the function. 

```{r}
   calcMortgage <- function( principal, years=30, APR=0.05 )
   {

      months <- years * 12
      int.rate <- APR / 12
      
      # amortization formula
      monthly.payment <- ( principal * int.rate ) / 
                         (1 - (1 + int.rate)^(-months) )
      
      monthly.payment <- round( monthly.payment, 2 )
      
      return( monthly.payment )
   
   }
```


We can now run the function while omitting arguments, as long as they have defaults assigned.

```{r, eval=T}
calcMortgage( principal=100000  )
```



## Assignment

When we call a function in R, the default behavior of the function is typically to print the results on the screen:

```{r}
calcMortgage( principal=100000  )
```

If we are creating a script, however, we often need to save the function outputs at each step. We can do this by assigning output to a new variable.

```{r}
payments.15.year <- calcMortgage( years=15, principal=100000  )
payments.30.year <- calcMortgage( years=30, principal=100000  )
```

These values are then stored, and can be used later or printed by typing the object name:

```{r}
payments.15.year
payments.30.year
```

NOte that variable names can include periods or underscores. They can also include numbers, but they cannot start with a number. Like everything in R, they will be case sensitive.
